The Little Explorer

Liam was a curious 8-year-old boy with a mop of messy brown hair and a backpack always filled with "treasures"—smooth stones, broken shells, and sometimes even bugs (which his mom didn’t appreciate). Every day after school, he would explore the small forest behind his house, pretending to be a brave adventurer.

One afternoon, as he was digging near an old oak tree, his fingers brushed against something hard and metallic. His heart raced as he uncovered a small, rusted box. With trembling hands, he pried it open and found a faded map inside, its edges torn but the ink still visible.

Liam’s eyes widened. A real treasure map!

Excited, he followed the crinkled paper, stepping over roots and ducking under branches until he reached a spot marked with an "X." He dug eagerly—until his shovel hit something solid. It wasn’t gold or jewels, but an old toy spaceship buried years ago by another kid, just like him.

Liam grinned. Maybe he would leave something behind too—for the next little explorer.

And so, he placed his favorite marble inside the box, reburied it, and ran home, already dreaming of the next adventure.

The End.
